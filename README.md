# Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-CVRP-
Optimizing vehicle routing for efficient delivery of goods to various customer locations while minimizing costs. This project implements algorithms to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Python and frameworks like Google OR-Tools and the nearest neighbor heuristic, with the latter being used for comparison purposes. 

## Dataset
The dataset can be found in the `customerData` file as a CSV file. Here are the details:
- 10 customers

## Prerequisites
- Python (version version 3.8+ on Linux, macOS or Windows)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, ortools

- ## Usage
